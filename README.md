# Ghostbusters_Trap

I've been meaning to add more to this page. I built a ghost trap with auto-opening doors, smoke effects, and strobing lights. This was made possible using an Arduino Pro Mini, two servos from AliExpress, one e-cigarette, a mini air pump, two 14650 lithium batteries, a foot switch (an eBay special for a sewing machine), and a few other components like rods to connect the doors to the servos. And, of course, one hacksaw... yes, you’ll need to saw an internal module in half to modify it for the gears to work, but it’s a simple job. Cramming all the wiring in, however, was the real challenge.
